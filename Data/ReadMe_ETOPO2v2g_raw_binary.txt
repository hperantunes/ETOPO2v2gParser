raw-binary grids for ETOPO2v2g 2006 (Grid-centered registration)

NOTE: the ETOPO2v2 grid-centered registration grids have recently been re-worked in order
      to repair some problems. 

This folder contains 4 zipped ETOPO2v2g grids.

Each zipped grid contains the entire 10801 by 5401 ETOPO2v2g world gridline-registered grid along
with an ASCII Arc-style Header.

Files are as follows:

ETOPO2v2g_i2_LSB.zip - 2-byte integer grid with Least Significant Byte First (littleendian)

ETOPO2v2g_i2_MSB.zip - 2-byte integer grid with Most Significant Byte First (bigendian)

ETOPO2v2g_f4_LSB.zip - 4-byte floating pt grid with Least Significant Byte First (littleendian)

ETOPO2v2g_f4_MSB.zip - 4-byte floating pt grid with Most Significant Byte First (bigendian)

Note that the floating point grids import most easily into ArcMap application.
